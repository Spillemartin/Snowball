       Problem:
        Its painstakingly hard to find information about student unions in the site currently put in place for it. Its hidden behind menu upon menu, discouraging new students from searching for one they want to be a part of.
    </p>
    <p>
        Solution:
        A new version of the union site, where its much simpler to find what one is looking for. A simple greeting site which contains a dropdown menu containing all the necessary fields to find what you need.
        Clicking one of the fields will transfer you to a site containing all the unions participating in that field. Ex, unions -> sport -> a new site containing sport unions -> football -> Oslomet IL.
    </p>

        We have made a test version of this embeded into the website. If you hover over  the rightmost link in the navigation bar you can explore our makeshift solution for it. This is of course just a draft but hopefully will give an idea of what we are trying to achieve.
